                <h5>Professional Philosophy</h5>
                <p>
                  I believe that the definition of objectives and key results
                  (OKRs), both financial and strategic, are essential for
                  business success, because they strengthen decision-making
                  criteria, consolidate leadership in management, create
                  better-focused corporate governance, and develop a business
                  culture that drives analytical data management, creativity and
                  innovation as fundamental orientations for business growth,
                  profitability and customer satisfaction.
                </p>

                <h5>Professional Background & Expertise</h5>
                <p>
                  With this conviction, and my accumulated experience in
                  corporate management in the private sector and in the
                  formulation and management of macroeconomic policies in
                  governmental institutions, I collaborate with owners,
                  directors and managers to elevate the companies they lead
